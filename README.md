###DRAFT Intellectual Property Licensing Policy

#####1 PREAMBLE

To read the papers cited in this essay, one must pay publishing gatekeepers like Reed Elsevier or LexisNexis. Students of the University of Waterloo can access this content, it is built into our tuition, but a child in the Global South has little to no chance of accessing this content. This should be a deeply uncomfortable thought: information is granted according to privilege.

This essay serves as a provocation, an attempt to sketch out FRMlab's intrinsic political agenda in relation to creating, sharing and appropriating creative content. We believe that it is F_RMlab's responsibility - as a student society dedicated to digital design - to evanglecize and uphold the following three principles: 

1.	Steward alternative institutional models for politically-conscious, open, collaborative design research
2.	Critique and hold accountable aspects of the university's Intellectual Property policies that entrench global inequality
3.	Create and embed legal and technical infrastructures to promote universal access to information.

Design is increasingly digital and increasingly hosted, or produced online[1]. The school has, and will continue to move in this direction. FRMlab's workshops, research and tool developments are valuable because they are freely accessed and shared by our members and the global design community. Yet while our technical infrastructure reflects this participatory, open model, the legal structure of the group does not guarantee others can safely use and share our information. It is thus important to have an alternative copyright scheme for design content that reflects the civic values of the school. How can we ensure that we are not contributing to a gated global community? 

The Secretariat and Office of General Counsel lists the policies, procedures and guidelines that define the Intellectual Property (IP) rights provided to members of the University of Waterloo. In general, Policy 73 guarantees (except in certain well-defined situations) ownership of IP rights with the content creator[2] and thus the university dose not take, a priori, any share of revenue, ownership, copyright or other obligations for IP rights. This system places the onus on students to affirm common usage licensing. Consequently, our copyright scheme privatizes our knowledge by default:  the work that is being created by the school of architecture everyday - mapping data, survey information,  geometric models of the city - by default may not be distributed, modified, reproduced in whole or in part without prior permission of the content creator.

An ongoing, collaborative experiment like FRMlab cannot survive under this existing copyright system. We thus choose to actively define our own IP model that safeguards and formalizes the group's participatory spirit. Our IP system balances the rights and legal protection of our content creators, while encouraging our work to be shared in the public sphere. FRMlab membership will entail by default, an agreement to share all work produced within the group through common usage licenses. Works of art, reports or videos will be licensed under the most recent version of the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) [4] and software will be licensed by the LGPL license from the Free Software Foundation (cite). Members have the option of selecting an alternative licensing scheme that guarantees further rights, FRMlab will provide a list of approved open source licenses from the Open Source Initiative[5]. Members can also choose to opt out of open source licensing and reserve all rights to their works. The agreement document is modified from the 'model intellectual property licensing policy for foundations' (cite) from the Creative Commons and in keeping with their practise, the agreement is dedicated to the public domain. F_RMlab will host on its Github account [5], where anyone can freely copy and modify it without attribution. 

We invite other student societies in the UWSA to adopt this agreement for work produced. We would also like to have the faculty adopt our licensing ethos for the work they are creating and publishing.
