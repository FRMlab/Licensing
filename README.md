####1 PREAMBLE

To read the papers cited in this essay, one must pay publishing gatekeepers like Reed Elsevier or LexisNexis[1]. Students of the University of Waterloo can access this content, it is built into our tuition, but a child in the Global South has little to no chance of access. This should be a deeply uncomfortable thought: information is granted according to privilege. Our default models of copyright and access (including the University of Waterloo's Intellectual Property policy) contribute to a gated global community by locking content access and usage to a privileged few. [Contradiction at heart of UWSA community is that we support and promote policies that keep our ideas about cities, architecture from public domain - but are generally commerically copyrighted meaning - public work in not actually available in the public work.] 

This essay serves as a provocation and an earnest attempt to sketch out an inherent political agenda for F_RMlab in relation to appropriating and sharing architecture and urban ideas. Secondly extend these ideas to broader themes of architecture and urbanism. 
[1. F_RMlab contradiction + solution, 2. Extension to broader AEC industry (GIS) 3. What is the potential of OS in architecture?]. 

[1] F_RMlab's research and design efforts succeed because they are freely accessed and shared by our members and the global design community. Yet while the work we have done and technical infrastructure we use reflects this participatory spirit - the legal structure of the group does not guarantee others can safely work with our information. The Secretariat and Office of General Counsel lists the policies, procedures and guidelines that define the Intellectual Property (IP) rights provided to members of the University of Waterloo. In general, Policy 73 guarantees (except in certain well-defined situations) ownership of IP rights with the content creator[2] and thus the university does not take, _a priori_, any share of revenue, ownership, copyright or other obligations for them. This system places the onus on students to affirm common usage licensing. Consequently, our copyright scheme privatizes our knowledge by default:  the work that is being created by F_RMlab - mapping data, code, workshop lessons - by default may not be distributed, modified, reproduced in whole or in part without prior permission of the content creator. So it is important for F_RMlab to have an alternative copyright scheme that reflects the civic values of our ongoing collaboration. Specifically, we can choose to share our work and the terms by which it is appropriated. That is why the F_RMlab constitution articulates that all F_RMlab work by default is entered into F_RMlab's open content copyright scheme[1].

[2] Design practice is continuing to shift towards digital content creation and online information access. For this reason we have new opportunities to share the work we produce and empower others to build on our efforts. Specifically, we can choose to share our work and the terms by which it is appropriated.This contradiction between our working method and it's legal permissiveness is also apparent in broader issues in the architecture and urban design industry.
- inexpensive computation, almost-free electronics, Internet, wireless communication, high-performance materials, new design, fabrication, and supply-chain technologies
- address societal problems - through OSB
- higher level 'systems architecture'
 Architecture and city work is public. It belongs in the public domain. For example if you wanted to purchase a map of Toronto, it would cost your $5.00. " Generally these places have given the task of mapping to various government agencies who in return get to make money by selling the data back to you and me. If you live in one of these countries, then your taxes pay for the mapping and then you have to pay again to get a copy of it." "Refined data and finished maps are generally commercially copyrighted[1]." One could access it through the school's GIS library, built into our tuition.  Everytime you trace Google Earth, Baidu map "Data retains the copyright conditions of the original. In practice this means your data subject to the licensing fees, and contractual restirctions of the providers."  Likewise, there is a lot of knowledge and data produced within our school. We spend hours, locked in our studios and offices - tracing maps in CAD, making 3D models of cities, contributing to academic journals - constructing a wealth of knowledge that can help others and then hoarding it: letting it slowly die in our hard drives, our portfolios. Larger framework (i) GIS (ii) writings (iii) design engines (iv) simulation and optimization methods (v) fabrication data (vi) sensors (vi) manafacturing. [This should be more focused]. 
This leads to "Global commons of low-cost, high-performance products."

[3] "Global commons of low-cost, high-performance products."
- new model for the AECD industry, based on integration of opensource methods so that tackle societal problems via architecture: make high quality design solutions cheap, efficient. Global communities can freely collaborate to find best solutions for problems. 
- Open Source Building -> MIT
- Wikihouse 

We believe that it is F_RMlab's responsibility - as a student society dedicated to digital design - to do exactly this and steward an institutional model for open, collaborative design research.  In this vein, we have determined three core principles of F_RMlab's political mission:

1. Critique and hold accountable aspects of the university's Intellectual Property policies that entrench global inequality.
2. Vet and promote licensing agreements, specific to design content, that reduces the technical overhead for students and faculty to open-source their work.   
3. Create and embed technical infrastructures to promote universal access to information, regardless of legality.

We thus choose to first, actively define our own IP model that safeguards and formalizes the group's participatory spirit. Our IP system balances the rights and legal protection of our content creators, while encouraging our work to be shared in the public sphere. Secondly we are developing and promoting technical infrastructures that allow anyone to access our work. We'd like to invite other students, student societies and faculty members to open up the work they are creating and publishing and adopt our technical and legal infrastructures.

We realize we are not the only ones interested in opening up data and access within our school and the profession. Yet if we continue to act alone, our efforts remain fragmented. There is a lot of knowledge and data produced within our school. We spend hours, locked in our studios and offices - tracing maps in CAD, making 3D models of cities, contributing to academic journals - constructing a wealth of knowledge that can help others and then hoarding it: letting it slowly die in our hard drives, our portfolios. It doesn't benefit us and doesn't benefit our broader community.

#####ROUGH/TRASH
An ongoing, collaborative experiment like FRMlab cannot survive under this existing copyright system. We thus choose to actively define our own IP model that safeguards and formalizes the group's participatory spirit. Our IP system balances the rights and legal protection of our content creators, while encouraging our work to be shared in the public sphere. FRMlab membership will entail by default, an agreement to share all work produced within the group through common usage licenses. Works of art, reports or videos will be licensed under the most recent version of the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) [4] and software will be licensed by the LGPL license from the Free Software Foundation (cite). Members have the option of selecting an alternative licensing scheme that guarantees further rights, FRMlab will provide a list of approved open source licenses from the Open Source Initiative[5]. Members can also choose to opt out of open source licensing and reserve all rights to their works. The agreement document is modified from the 'model intellectual property licensing policy for foundations' (cite) from the Creative Commons and in keeping with their practise, the agreement is dedicated to the public domain. F_RMlab will host on its Github account [5], where anyone can freely copy and modify it without attribution.
