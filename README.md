###DRAFT Intellectual Property Licensing Policy

#####1 PREAMBLE

To read the papers cited in this essay, one must pay publishing gatekeepers like Reed Elsevier or LexisNexis. Students of the University of Waterloo can access this content, it is built into our tuition, but a child in the Global South has little to no chance of accessing this content. This should be a deeply uncomfortable thought: information is granted according to privilege. Our default models of copyright and access, including the Univerity of Waterloo's Intellectual Property policy, contribute to a gated global community by locking content access and usage to a priveliged few. 

We would like to address this: this essay serves as a provocation, an attempt to sketch out FRMlab's inherent political agenda in relation to creating, sharing and appropriating creative content. 

FRMlab's workshops, research and tool developments are valuable because they are freely accessed and shared by our members and the global design community. By using online platforms to host information, we can bypass traditional gatekeepers of information. Yet while our technical infrastructure reflects this participatory, open model, the legal structure of the group does not guarantee others can safely use and share our information. 

The Secretariat and Office of General Counsel lists the policies, procedures and guidelines that define the Intellectual Property (IP) rights provided to members of the University of Waterloo. In general, Policy 73 guarantees (except in certain well-defined situations) ownership of IP rights with the content creator[2] and thus the university dose not take, a priori, any share of revenue, ownership, copyright or other obligations for IP rights. This system places the onus on students to affirm common usage licensing. Consequently, our copyright scheme privatizes our knowledge by default:  the work that is being created by us - mapping data, code, workshop information - by default may not be distributed, modified, reproduced in whole or in part without prior permission of the content creator.

It is important for FRMlab to have an alternative copyright scheme that reflects the civic values of our ongoing collaboration. But we also think, perhaps, this is bigger than just us. Design practice is continuing to shift towards digital content creation and online information access. For this reason we have new opportunities to share the work we produce and empower others to build on our efforts. Specifically, we can ensure our work can be accessed by the public under terms that allow anyone to copy, use, make and distribute it. We believe that it is F_RMlab's responsibility - as a student society dedicated to digital design - to steward alternative institutional models for open, collaborative design research. This involves upholding three principles:

1.	Critique and hold accountable aspects of the university's Intellectual Property policies that entrench global inequality.
2.  Vet and promote licensing agreements specific to design content, that reduces the technical overhead for students and faculty to open-source their work.   
3.	Create and embed technical infrastructures to promote universal access to information.

We thus choose to actively define our own IP model that safeguards and formalizes the group's participatory spirit. Our IP system balances the rights and legal protection of our content creators, while encouraging our work to be shared in the public sphere. We are also continuing to experiment with technical infrastructures that allow anyone to access our work: through our Github account and our blog.

We realize we are not the only ones interested in opening up data and access within our profession. Yet if we continue to act alone, our efforts remain fragmented. There is a lot of knowledge and data produced within our school that could benefit the public. We'd like to invite other student societies, grad and faculty members to open up the work they are creating and publishing, to debate our proposition, and adopt our technical and legal infrastructures.

###ROUGH
An ongoing, collaborative experiment like FRMlab cannot survive under this existing copyright system. We thus choose to actively define our own IP model that safeguards and formalizes the group's participatory spirit. Our IP system balances the rights and legal protection of our content creators, while encouraging our work to be shared in the public sphere. FRMlab membership will entail by default, an agreement to share all work produced within the group through common usage licenses. Works of art, reports or videos will be licensed under the most recent version of the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) [4] and software will be licensed by the LGPL license from the Free Software Foundation (cite). Members have the option of selecting an alternative licensing scheme that guarantees further rights, FRMlab will provide a list of approved open source licenses from the Open Source Initiative[5]. Members can also choose to opt out of open source licensing and reserve all rights to their works. The agreement document is modified from the 'model intellectual property licensing policy for foundations' (cite) from the Creative Commons and in keeping with their practise, the agreement is dedicated to the public domain. F_RMlab will host on its Github account [5], where anyone can freely copy and modify it without attribution.
